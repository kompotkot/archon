# User Story: "Create System Context diagram"

**ID:** US001  
**Priority:** `High`  
**Persona:** Software Architect

## Story

As a software architect, I want to create a C4 Level 1 **System Context** diagram for my product, using the system concept, constraints, and requirements defined in `docs/definitions`, so that stakeholders share a single, unambiguous view of the system boundary, primary actors, and external dependencies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A **Mermaid** diagram file exists at `docs/diagrams/context/cntx.mermaid` and renders without errors.
- [ ] The diagram follows **C4 Level 1** semantics:
  - [ ] Exactly one **System of Interest** (the product) is clearly identified and visually distinct.
  - [ ] All **primary user personas / actors** interacting with the system are present (at minimum: Developer/Architect; include any others explicitly mentioned in definitions).
  - [ ] All **external systems** explicitly required by definitions are shown as external dependencies (e.g., VCS, CI, LLM provider, diagram renderer, storage, identity provider — only if mandated by definitions).
  - [ ] Relationships are labeled with concise verbs (e.g., "creates design tasks", "stores definitions", "generates diagrams") and directionality is correct.
- [ ] The diagram is consistent with `docs/definitions`:
  - [ ] No components/containers are introduced unless they are referenced as _external systems_ at context level.
  - [ ] Constraints that affect context (mandatory tech/services, deployment boundaries, compliance, "C4 is the only framework") are reflected as notes/annotations or external dependencies (as appropriate).
- [ ] Output location is correct: `docs/diagrams/context/` contains only context-level assets (no container/component diagrams mixed in).

## Notes

- Definitions purpose (must be reflected in the diagram scope):
  - **Description**: system concept/overview/goals (drives system boundary + key interactions)
  - **Constraints**: mandatory technologies/limits (drives external dependencies + boundary notes)
  - **Requirements**: behaviors/attributes (drives relationships and external actors)
- Keep Level 1 strict: avoid "internal engines/agents" unless they are explicitly treated as separate external systems at this level. Agents typically belong to **Container (L2)**.
- Naming convention: use stable product name (from `Description`) and consistent actor names (from definitions).
